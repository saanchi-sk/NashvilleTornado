# NashvilleTornado
This project was undertaken to understand any correlations between the damages observed during the 2019 Nashville tornado and the built environment.

**Data**

The tornado data was gathered from the NOAA website, the damage data was from a previous site visit from the fulcrum app and the county and census shape files were taken from fata.gov.in.

The damage data was obtained by a webscapper, since i did not have access to it directly. I saved the csv from the webscaper and have implemented that directly in this notebook.
